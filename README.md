# Interactive Web GIS Map of Fast-Food Outlets (Mapbox GL JS)

This project demonstrates the development of an interactive Web GIS application using Mapbox GL JS, combining spatial data, front-end web technologies, and user-driven interaction. The application visualises fast-food outlet locations in Victoria, Australia, using an interactive map paired with a dynamic sidebar list.

The project showcases how spatial data can be transformed into a user-friendly web mapping interface, supporting exploration, navigation, and information retrieval—a core skill in modern Web GIS, urban informatics, and spatial data communication.

Takeaway:
This project demonstrates the core building blocks of a modern Web GIS application, integrating spatial data, interactive mapping, and front-end logic into a cohesive, user-centred interface. Beyond visualising point locations, it shows how geographic information can be structured, linked, and communicated through dynamic interactions between maps and user interface elements. The workflow highlights practical skills in spatial data handling, client-side rendering, event-driven interaction, and geographic storytelling, forming a foundation for more advanced Web GIS systems such as urban analytics dashboards, location-based services, and digital twin interfaces. Overall, the project reflects how Web GIS can be used to translate spatial data into accessible, actionable insights for urban and spatial decision-making contexts.
